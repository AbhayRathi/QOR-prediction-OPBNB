# QOR (Quantum-Optimized Robotics Network)

A decentralized network where robots/AI agents, quantum optimizers, and people coordinate via smart contracts (mocked for MVP). Agents stake to register, communities run prediction markets on mission success, an oracle verifies outcomes, and a DAO governs the network.
